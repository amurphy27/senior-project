This document will cover the best way I have found to get all the files setup up so everything lines up properly.
First begin with your desired pdf and make sure it's name lines up with the title in the xml file. (title.pdf)
If the pdf is editable with the special adobe stuff. Flatten it to remove the editable stuff. Plenty of online tools for this.
Next convert the pdf to a jpg. 
If the pdf has multiple pages most tools I have came across will give you a zip of multiple jpgs. One for each page. Combine
all of these jpgs together in order so you get one very tall jpg. Once again plenty of online tools for this. The very tall
jpg is the one we are going to want to use. Similarly to the pdf, name it to line up with the title in the xml file. (title.jpg)

To help with find the measurements needed for the width, height, x and y coords I personally used gimp since it has an option
to display coordinates in mm rather than pixels like most other tools that look at coordinates of images.
Now you can either use the jpg or the pdf to get the measurements but I recommend using the pdf since it is the original and
should be the golden standard.

As a way to double check that you are have a correctly sized image (pdf or jpg being viewed) make sure that the width of a page is
215.9mm and the height is 279.4mm.
