How To Add More XML And Change Forms In Use
Its simple. Go into XMLParser.php and change the filename to the xml you want to parse and send to the database.
Make sure the xml file you want to use is in the XML directory and the names match up and everything.
Then just go to pcr-wa-015.org/paper/XMLParser.php
If it worked it will say Connected Successfully.
Otherwise it didn't work.
Just a view little caviots to this process...
If you want to change an existing form, you would have to delete the old templatefields from the database first since duplicates are
not allowed. This IS NOT reccomended since all old forms that use the old template would also need to be deleted from the database,
otherwise lots of errors would be popping up when they are opened in the future.
To get arround this my recommendation would be to name the title in the new xml slightly differently like 6080_v1 or something
like that so the old versions will still be accessable.
Once a new template is made you then need to update the chooseForm.php to add another link or update the old existing one.
In the case of changing an existing one simply change the existing hidden input value for formName (below example for 6080)
<input type="hidden" name="formName" value="6080">
to the new desired form template. (example below if we are changing it to 6080_v1)
<input type="hidden" name="formName" value="6080_v1">
THIS WILL ONLY CHANGE THE TEMPLATE USED FOR THE BUTTON
If you want to change the name displayed on the button change the value on the submit input. (example below)
<input id="newFormButton" type="submit" value="THIS VALUE">
Just make sure it is in the same form block as the one you are trying to change.
Alternatively if you want to add an entirely new form to the chooseForm.php page simply copy the below code, put in the desired
values and place it after line 78
<div class="overview-boxes">
but before the closing of this div tag. (</div>) at this time line 115
Also make sure that you that the code below is not placed within another div block they will have the class box. The parent block
should be the previously mentioned div with the class overview-boxes.
Only 2 things to change are TITLE_IN_XML which should match the title given in the xml file you want this button to link to.
And DISPLAY_NAME which will be the name seen by users on the webpage.
--- CODE TO USE BELOW ---
<div class="box">
    <div class="right-side">
    <div class="box-topic">
        <form action="EditForm.php" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="formName" value="TITLE_IN_XML">
        <!--new form-->
        <input type="hidden" name="formState" value="newForm"> 
        <input id="newFormButton" type="submit" value="DISPLAY_NAME">
        </form>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>
