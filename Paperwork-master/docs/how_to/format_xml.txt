How To Format The XML

Below is a basic skeleton of what would make up the XML, it is pretty simple since a form is essentially just
a title and a bunch of fields.

<form name= form_type >
	<field name= field_name  type= field_type  x= field_x_position  y= field_y_position  width= field_width  height= field_height ></field>
	more fields
</form>

The naming convention of the .xml files doesn't infulence anything so that part is completely up to you.

=== form_type ===
form_type unlike the name of the .xml file will dictate a lot of different things however. First off it will dictate the name of the form as
it appears on the website. More importantly though for everything to work the .jpg and .pdf files for this form will need to be form_type.jpg.

=== field_name ===
field_name will be the name that this field appears as in the database for readability nothing else.

=== field_type ===
field_type is the type of html input a field will be.
For example most fields are text since most fields are written in answers.
Other types would be checkbox for all checkbox and bubble selections,
date and datetime for selecting dates and dates + times respectively,
as well as our own special case signature for all signatures/initials needed.
Theoretically you could use any other input type offered by html but some would run into goofy cases like radio since radios are based on families
and we do not have the javascript implemented to deal with said families so the values going into the database would be a lil off.


This is where creating the xml gets tedious and annoying in all honesty. Notably due to the fact that you need to get measurements for every field
which just takes time. To help save some time and make sure everything fits and lines up correctly on the website and the pdfs created I made
seperate instructions entitled setup_files_for_forms.txt.

=== field_x_position ===
This is the distance from the left side of the page to the top left corner of the part of the field you want the input.
Positions can go out one decimal point. (00.x)
Below is an example since I know I am hard to understand though writing.
Where the ' is, is about where you want this measurement to be, probably a lil higher, up to whomever is making the xml.
My recomendation however is that you make the input as big as it possibly can while fitting in the box for readability and ease of use for the user.

|Full Name: '                                          |
+------------------------------------------------------+

The fun part is the measurement is in mm (millimeters), not px (pixels). More info will be in the previously mentioned setup instructions.

=== field_y_position ===
Similar to the x position but this is from the top edge of the FIRST page to the top left corner of the part of the field you want the input.
Positions can go out one decimal point. (00.x)
Same spot as the previously shown example above.
As mentioned the y position is the distance from the first page of the document. To make things easier a page is 279.4 mm tall. So if you are measuring
a page at a time just add 279.4 * the number of pages past the first one to get an accurate y position.

=== field_width ===
The field width is the width of the field input. Like with previous attributes to the field I provided an example below.
Width only stores whole numbers. If you put a decimal in the xml it will either drop the decimal or round, either way it technically will still work but not
include the decimals.
The important part is still represented by a bunch of '
Measurement should still be in mm.

+------------------------------------------------------+
|Full Name: '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' |
+------------------------------------------------------+

=== field_height ===
Once a again similar to the width it is the distance from the top of the input to the bottom of it, still in mm.
Just like the width, the height only stores whole numbers.
